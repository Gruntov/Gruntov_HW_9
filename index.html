            <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
            <p>The Eiffel Tower is so monumental that it's difficult to capture by camera. One solution is to photograph from a distance. Across the Seine River, the Jardins du Trocadéro provides a perfect vantage point, with its spacious esplanade and ornamental pools serving as a lovely foreground. From this angle at sunrise, the golden light creates an enchanting background for the Iron Lady.</p>

            <h2>Versailles Gardens</h2>
            <p>In the 17th century, renowned landscape designer André Le Nôtre created the gardens of the Château de Versailles in his trademark style of formality and restraint. Immaculately trimmed shrubbery, tidy rows of flower beds, ornamental pools, fountains, and statues make the gardens seem more like artwork than nature.</p>
